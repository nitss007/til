Dot Product of Sparse vectors
https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124823/

    Find an efficient way to represent a vector (1,1,1,1,1,1,22,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9,9,99,9,,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,34,3,4,,3,3,3,3....)
    Use the representation you come up with to compute dot product of two vectors
        Ex: If you come up with MyDataStructure to represent a vector, then your function signature will be
        int dotProduct(MyDataStructure vector1, MyDataStructure vector2)
        // dot product of two vectors [1,2,3,4] and [5,6,7,8] is 1 * 5 + 2 * 6 + 3 * 7 + 4 * 8
        Take advantage of your "efficient" representation to compute the dot product faster.

Some questions are the closest that it can get to the actual question. Like Russian Doll envelopes or Task Scheduler.
