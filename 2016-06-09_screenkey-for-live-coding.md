## Screenkey for Live Coding

[screenkey](https://github.com/wavexx/screenkey) is a python app which shows key presses in an overlay on the screen. Nice for live coding to show off key combinations and shortcuts.

`--mods-only` shows only modifiers, because normal letters are probably not interesting and `--vis-shift` shows shift every time it is pressed.

No installation required, just start the app after cloning the repo `./screenkey --mods-only --vis-shift`
