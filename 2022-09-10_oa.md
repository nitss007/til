Find the total sum of the imbalance of all possible groups

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0 
[2], range = 2 - 2 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,2], range = 2 - 1 = 1
[2,3], range = 3 - 2 = 1
[1,2,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
