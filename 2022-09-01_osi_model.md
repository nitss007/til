Computer Networking - Part 1: Introduction

Our goal in this series is to interconnect between computer systems, or basically talk about how the Internet works.

Basically a network architecture is a set of layers and protocols. A protocol is a set of rules which are agreed among peers on how communication should be conducted. Overall computer networking is made up of multiple protocols at different layers (differ between networks). Regarding the layers, there is a protocol the hierarchy sometimes called “protocol stack”. 

On the sending side, every layer sends information (data and control) to the layer below until we get to the lowest layer. On the receiving side the information flows from the lower layer to the most upper one. Probably the most well known conceptual model for describing networking is the “OSI Model”. This model has 7 layers each handling different aspects of networking (as described next).

“Physical Layer” which is responsible for transferring bits over some medium (such as RF or optical cables).
 
“Data Link Layer” which is responsible for splitting the “flow of bits” into frames and ensuring there are no transmission errors (they are protocols which can also fix some transmission errors and thus avoid the retransmissions by upper layers).

“Network Layer” which is responsible for routing the packets between a sender and a receiver. There are two families of protocols in this layer: routed protocols (holding source and destination information needed for routing) and routing protocols (managing the routing tables among the routers across the network) - more on them in future write-ups.

“Transport Layer” which has two major protocol families: connectionless (not starting a connection before sending data and best effort) and connection oriented (creating a connection before sending data and adding acknowledgement mechanism to ensure data was received). Lastly, this layer also allows multiplexing a couple of applications for communication on the same hosts (like TCP/UDP ports).

“Session Layer” which is responsible for initiating and creating a session between both ends of the communication. 
 
“Presentation Layer” which is responsible for ensuring the data passed between the sender and the receiver is understandable between both parties.

“Application Layer” which is responsible for the protocol used by the application (web browsing, email, messaging, etc.) itself. 

Also, it is important to remember that the “OSI Model” is a reference only, and not all the protocol stacks implement the entire 7 layers (which we will talk about in the future). In the table below we can see for each layer a small list of protocols as an example (https://bit.ly/3x8e411).
