You are given n tasks labeled from 0 to n - 1 represented by a 2D integer array tasks, where tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei] means that the 
ith task will be available to process at enqueueTimei and will take processingTimei to finish processing.
You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:
If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest processing time. If multiple tasks have the same shortest
processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.
Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.
 
Example 1:
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]    //[enqueueTimei, processingTimei]
Output: [0,2,3,1] 
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.

Example 2:
Input: tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]]
Output: [4,3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows:
- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.
- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.
- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.
- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.

Q:

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1


int nums[] = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18];
int[][] dp = int[nums.length+1][nums.length+1];

public int fun(nums){
    if(nums.length<1)   
        return -1;
    else if(nums.length ==1)    
        return 1;
    int curMax =0, max= 0;    
    for(int i=;i<nums.length;i++)
    Arrays.fill(dp,-1);
    for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)    {
        curMax = fun(nums, 0);
        max= Math.max(curMax, max);
    }
    return max;
        
}
public int fun(nums, int ind){
    if(ind>=nums.length)
    return 1;
    
    if(dp[ind][ind != -1)
     return dp[ind][ind];
    
    for(int i=ind+1;i<nums.length;i++)
        if(nums[i]) >nums[ind])
               return 1+fun(nums, i);
                
}
