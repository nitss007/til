𝟮)𝗙𝗥𝗨𝗚𝗔𝗟 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗚
It uses only one unit of memory per group to compute a quantile for each group.
𝙐𝙨𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙨𝙚: Find the nth percentile of the data stream.

𝟯)𝗚𝗘𝗢𝗛𝗔𝗦𝗛/ 𝗦𝟮 𝗚𝗘𝗢𝗠𝗘𝗧𝗥𝗬
A collection of efficient yet exact mathematical predicates for testing relationships among geometric primitives.
𝙐𝙨𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙨𝙚:Location-based search results with DynamoDb and Geohash.

𝟰)𝗛𝗬𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗟𝗢𝗚𝗟𝗢𝗚
It is an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset.
𝙐𝙨𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙨𝙚: privacy-preserving traffic heat map for the city.
