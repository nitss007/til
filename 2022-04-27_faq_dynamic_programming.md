Dice Throw Problem: Given n dice each with m faces, numbered from 1 to m, find the number of ways to get sum X. X is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

Coin Change: You are given n types of coin denominations of values v(1) < v(2) < ... < v(n) (all integers). Assume v(1) = 1, so you can always make change for any amount of money C. Give an algorithm which makes change for an amount of money C with as few coins as possible.

Counting Boolean Parenthesizations: You are given a boolean expression consisting of a string of the symbols 'true', 'false', 'and', 'or', and 'xor'. Count the number of ways to parenthesize the expression such that it will evaluate to true. For example, there is only 1 way to parenthesize 'true and false xor true' such that it evaluates to true.

Subset Sum Problem: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

Minimum Number of Jumps: Given an array of integers where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be made forward from that element, find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).

Two-Person Traversal of a Sequence of Cities: You are given an ordered sequence of n cities, and the distances between every pair of cities. You must partition the cities into two subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) such that person A visits all cities in the first subsequence (in order), person B visits all cities in the second subsequence (in order), and such that the sum of the total distances travelled by A and B is minimized. Assume that person A and person B start initially at the first city in their respective subsequences.

Balanced Partition: You have a set of n integers each in the range 0 ... K. Partition these integers into two subsets such that you minimize |S1 - S2|, where S1 and S2 denote the sums of the elements in each of the two subsets.

Optimal Strategy for a Game: Consider a row of n coins of values v(1) ... v(n), where n is even. We play a game against an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if we move first.

Maximum Value Contiguous Subsequence: Given a sequence of n real numbers A(1) ... A(n), determine a contiguous subsequence A(i) ... A(j) for which the sum of elements in the subsequence is maximized.

Edit Distance: Given two text strings A of length n and B of length m, you want to transform A into B with a minimum number of operations of the following types: delete a character from A, insert a character into A, or change some character in A into a new character. The minimal number of such operations required to transform A into B is called the edit distance between A and B.
