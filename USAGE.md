# Today I learned

A nice idea I saw while exploring GitHub. I'm going to track my learning process in this repo. Anything new I learn about the craft of Software Engineering will end up here.

## Usage

```bash
./generate Some Pretty Title with Title Case
```

will generate a file like `YYYY-MM-DD_some-pretty-title-case.md` with the following contents:

```md
## Some Pretty Title with Title Case


```

Edit the file, run `./compile` and then commit and push.
