MBA programs don't have a monopoly on business knowledge.

You can create your own real-world MBA and do it in a quarter of the time.

Josh Kaufman wrote the international best seller, "The Personal MBA."

He's spent over a decade sifting through the best business books in the world so you don't have to.
