Q1. Given a sequence of coins each one facing upward (Head) or downward (Tail), we say it is a 'beautiful' sequence if all heads are before the tails.
More formally, a beatiful sequence is of the form HH...TTT. For example HHTT, HHHTT, HTTT are beatiful sequences while HHTHT, THHTT are not.
Note that also only heads or only tails sequence are considered beautiful, e.g. HHH or TTT.
Write a program that takes as input a string representing the coins sequence and output the minimum number of coin flips (H -> T or T->H) necessary to make the sequence beatiful.

For example, given the sequence HHTHTT, the answer should be 1 since it sufficient to flip the last H to make it beatiful (HHTTTT).

Ans - Can be solved using https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-string-to-monotone-increasing/ replacing "0" with "H" and "1" with "T".

Q2. Given an array ranks of ranks of students in a school. All students need to be split into groups k. Find the total 'imbalance' of all groups. An imabalance of a group can be found as :

    Sorting each group in the order of their ranks.
    A group contributes to imbalance if any 2 students in the sorted array have a rank difference of more than 1.

Find the total sum of imbalance of all such groups.

This is the example that was given :
[4,1,3,2]
[1] contributes 0 to imbalance
[2] contributes 0 to imbalance
[3] contributes 0 to imbalance
[4] contributes 0 to imbalance
[4,1] contributes 1 to imbalance
[4,3] contributes 0 to imbalance
[4,2] contributes 1 to imbalance
[4,1,3,2] contributes 0 to imbalance
[1,3] contributes 1 to imbalance
[1,2] contributes 0 to imbalance
[3,2] contributes 0 to imbalance
Answer = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3


```
public static long imbalance(List<Integer> rank) {
	long imbalance = 0;
	int r = 0;
	TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
	while(r < rank.size()-1) {
		set.clear();
		set.add(rank.get(r));
		long curImbalance = 0;
		for(int i=r+1; i<rank.size(); i++) {
			Integer e = rank.get(i);
			set.add(e);
			Integer f = set.lower(e);
			Integer c = set.higher(e);
			
			if(f == null) { // added at beginning
				curImbalance += (((c - e) > 1) ? 1 : 0);
			}
			else if(c == null) {// added at end
				curImbalance += (((e - f) > 1) ? 1 : 0);
			}
			else {
				curImbalance += (c - f) > 1 ? -1 : 0;
				curImbalance += (((c - e) > 1) ? 1 : 0);
				curImbalance += (((e - f) > 1) ? 1 : 0);
			}
			imbalance += curImbalance;
		}
		r++;
	}
	return imbalance;
